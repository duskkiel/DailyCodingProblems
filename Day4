# Day 4 of Coding Problems
# Question asked in Stripe interview.
# Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time
#   and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not
#   exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

import random

intList = []
upperBound = 10
lowerBound = -10
listLength = input("How many numbers in list? ")

for i in range(0, int(listLength)):
    intList.append(random.randint(lowerBound, upperBound))

print("List - " + str(intList))

for i in range(0, len(intList)):
    if i not in intList:
        if i >= 1:
            print("\nLowest Positive Missing Integer: " + str(i))
            break
